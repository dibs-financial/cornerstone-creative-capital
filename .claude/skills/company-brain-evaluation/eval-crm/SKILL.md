description: >
  Evaluate a team's legacy CRM situation — Salesforce, HubSpot, another
  system, or none — and how it relates to their company brain. Run as part of
  day-ai/company-brain-evaluation's Phase 1 fan-out, or standalone. Discovers the system of
  record, the human data-entry burden, and any existing sync; grades against
  the requirements bar; returns a findings block for COMPANY-BRAIN-UPGRADE.md.

# eval-crm

Read `../eval/requirements-bar.md` for the bar and the findings format, then
the doc matching what you find: `../eval/salesforce.md` or
`../eval/hubspot.md` (same pattern; more systems will get docs over time).

**Posture:** they keep their CRM. The play is the bridge, not the migration.
Nothing in this evaluation asks them to rip anything out.

## 1. Discover what they use

- Salesforce? HubSpot? Something else? **Nothing?**
- If **no CRM** (founder persona): this is the short, happy path. They can
  skip the legacy step entirely — Day AI is a superset of legacy CRM, and
  standardizing early means they may simply never need one. Record that as
  the finding and route the persona note back to company-brain-evaluation's Phase 2.
- If a CRM exists: which objects are actually in use, how many seats, who
  administers it, any existing sync/integration code in the repo.

## 2. Is the data in the company brain — and is the brain in the CRM?

Both directions matter:

- **CRM → brain:** are pulls landing in their store? How fresh, how complete?
  (Structured pulls are a cache of what other systems already knew — note
  what's *not* in the CRM at all: what actually happened on calls, in email.)
- **Brain → CRM:** does anything write agent-generated context back? Under
  what credentials — per-user, or a god-mode service account / full-access
  API key? (This is the safety finding.)
- **The human contract:** who has recurring "update CRM" calendar blocks,
  literal or de facto? Get hours per week — a number, not a vibe. Collect
  hygiene evidence: stale stages, empty fields, "could not find company name."

## 3. Grade against the bar

**Safety:** writebacks must run under each user's own permissions — no
god-mode credential a departing admin becomes a resignation-letter risk.
**Performance:** the record should reflect this morning's call by this
afternoon, not the weekly hygiene sweep. **Capability:** stage changes and
new records should be events agents can act on, and the record should be
maintained *from primary sources* (meetings, email) at a granularity keyboard
entry never reached. **Adoption:** the test is calendar blocks — an upgraded
brain drives "update CRM" time to zero, and reps feel it in week one.

## 4. Ideal outcome (the thumb on the scale)

The CRM stays the system of record for as long as they want it to be. Data
entry by humans goes to zero: data-entry agents maintain the record from what
actually happened, writing back under each user's own auth via the MCP OAuth
pattern (customer-owned app → client ID/secret at workspace level → per-user
auth). The brain holds the full-resolution truth; the CRM holds the view of it
the org already trusts.

## 5. Return the standard findings block

Per `requirements-bar.md`. **DIY path:** API integration and sync infra,
per-user permission handling, writeback plumbing to fields that mostly don't
exist for this kind of data — built and maintained by hand. **With Day AI:**
the three-step OAuth pattern from `salesforce.md`/`hubspot.md`, then
data-entry agents with skills. **Sequence:** for the scale-up persona this is
the first felt win — "update CRM" blocks to zero is worth the price of entry
by itself and buys credibility for everything after it.
