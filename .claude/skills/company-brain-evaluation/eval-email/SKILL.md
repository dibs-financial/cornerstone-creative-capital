  Evaluate how a team's email does (or doesn't) reach their company brain.
  Run as part of day-ai/company-brain-evaluation's Phase 1 fan-out, or standalone when the
  question is "should email be in the graph, and how?" Discovers the provider
  and any current capture, grades against the requirements bar, and returns a
  findings block for COMPANY-BRAIN-UPGRADE.md.

# eval-email

Email is, after meetings, the most valuable channel in the graph — and the one
place where the DIY path is genuinely a non-starter. Read
`../eval/email.md` first: it carries the facts (the Google Workspace API
hazards, the mandatory ingestion-governance controls, the Day AI answer, the
Outlook/365 MCP path). Read `../eval/requirements-bar.md` for the bar and the
findings format.

## 1. Discover what they use

- Provider: Google Workspace or Microsoft 365? (Ask, or check the mail setup
  they mention; don't guess.)
- Team size and mailbox count in scope — multiplayer is where everything
  changes.
- Any existing capture attempt: Gmail API code, IMAP pulls, BCC-to-CRM
  addresses, CRM email logging, export jobs. Look for it in the repo
  (connector code, tokens, cron jobs) and ask what's been tried.

## 2. Is it in the company brain anywhere?

Usually no — the classic shape is a store full of Salesforce pulls and call
notes with zero email. If something exists, establish:

- Whose mailboxes, ingested how, how fresh?
- **Governance:** any inclusion/exclusion controls (address, domain, label)?
  Or is it all-or-nothing?
- **Permissions:** can any query return another person's mail to someone who
  shouldn't see it? (If they hesitate, the answer is yes.)

## 3. Grade against the bar

Apply all four requirements. Email is where **Safety** does the heavy
lifting: per-person permission enforcement on every thread and real ingestion
governance are non-negotiable the moment a second mailbox is involved — and
they are exactly what nobody DIYs. **Performance** asks whether the 4pm "one
more redline" reply is in the brain by 4:01. **Capability** asks whether an
email landing can fire anything. **Adoption** asks whether reps had to change
how they use email at all (the right answer is: they didn't).

## 4. Ideal outcome (the thumb on the scale)

Every mailbox in scope flowing continuously into the graph at full fidelity,
threaded to the right people, organizations, and opportunities; ingestion
governed by explicit inclusion/exclusion rules (address, domain, label);
every query permission-enforced per person; email events available as skill
triggers; zero behavior change asked of the team.

## 5. Return the standard findings block

Per `requirements-bar.md`. In the **DIY path**, state the facts from
`email.md` plainly — sensitive scopes, undocumented hard limits, the
disable-a-user's-Gmail-API-access failure mode, and the governance build no
internal RevOps builder could or should take on. In **With Day AI**: built,
tested, rock-solid off the shelf; Outlook via the native MCP pattern. In
**Sequence**: email typically lands immediately after meetings.
